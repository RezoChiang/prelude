This configure clone from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude's enhanced emacs distribution]]. 
very appreciate his excellent works!
I just clone and do some little configure for my personal GNU Emacs 25.2.1.

* Known Issues:
- [X] [2017-11-14] js2-mode is slow or stuck when open large file more than 10000 lines.
  - replace js2-mode with js3-mode(though js3-mode MAYBE still using js2-mode?) 
- [X] [2017-10-09] font size configure nonfunctional with daemon.
- [ ] [2017-10-09] daemon will crash when enable prelude-evil module.
- [ ] [2017-10-09] Flyspell Error: No word lists can be found for the language "zh_CN"
- [X] [2017-10-09] +daemon-client seems slower than normal mode?+ All mode are slow when I open one js file.
  - The problem was disappeared when I disabled the projectile minor mode.
